# Pizza Express

This is a collaborative project that @SanikaPotdar, @abiipereira and I have worked on.

###### Aim: 
To create a GUI based Java application using Swing control commands, to order pizzas.

###### Software Used: 
Java Netbeans, mySQL Database.

###### Description:
We have created 5 forms:
1.	Welcome page
2.	Sign up page
3.	Login page
4.	Menu page
5.	Billing page

Our main aim with this project was to make our application as user-friendly as possible, keeping in mind real world pizza ordering website structures.

Weâ€™ve used panels for distinction in layout, buttons for action calls, labels, text fields, password fields, scroll table for billing and extensively used images in labels for a clean and beautiful User Interface.

Our application starts with a welcome page, where you have options of sign up and login, each having a dedicated page to themselves. For sign up, the name, username and password are input from a text field into the database table called User. Further you login with the same details, and the database cross verifies your identity. On successful login, a Menu page opens, which we have extensively customized and designed to suit the needs of our application. Every pizza is displayed in bordered box, with a label displaying its price and button that adds it to the cart. Finally, user can click on the check out button, which will display the billing page. Price breakdown of each pizza and total amount to be paid is displayed on this final page.
